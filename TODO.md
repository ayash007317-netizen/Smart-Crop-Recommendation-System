# Task: Smart Crop Recommendation System

## Plan
- [x] Step 1: Update design system (index.css and tailwind.config.js) with agricultural color scheme
  - [x] Define primary colors (green tones)
  - [x] Define secondary colors (earth brown)
  - [x] Define accent colors (sky blue)
  - [x] Add custom gradients and shadows
- [x] Step 2: Create types and interfaces
  - [x] Weather data types
  - [x] Crop recommendation types
  - [x] Location types
- [x] Step 3: Create weather API service
  - [x] OpenWeather API integration
  - [x] Error handling
- [x] Step 4: Create crop recommendation logic
  - [x] Rule-based recommendation engine
  - [x] Fertilizer recommendations
  - [x] Irrigation schedule generator
  - [x] Yield prediction calculator
- [x] Step 5: Create UI components
  - [x] Location input component (GPS + manual)
  - [x] Environmental data display cards
  - [x] Crop recommendation cards
  - [x] Fertilizer recommendation section
  - [x] Irrigation schedule section
  - [x] Yield prediction section
- [x] Step 6: Create main page
  - [x] Integrate all components
  - [x] Add loading states
  - [x] Add error handling
- [x] Step 7: Update routes and App.tsx
- [x] Step 8: Test and validate
  - [x] Run lint
  - [x] Fix any issues
- [x] Step 9: Add city/village name feature
  - [x] Add city/village input field to LocationInput
  - [x] Display location name in EnvironmentalData
  - [x] Update Home page to handle location name
  - [x] Test and validate changes
- [x] Step 10: Add automatic location detection (reverse geocoding)
  - [x] Create reverse geocoding service
  - [x] Add LocationInfo interface
  - [x] Implement auto-detection for manual coordinates
  - [x] Enhance GPS detection with location names
  - [x] Add visual location indicator
  - [x] Implement debouncing for API calls
  - [x] Add loading states and error handling
  - [x] Test and validate all scenarios

## Notes
- This is a pure frontend application - no database needed
- Uses OpenWeather API for real-time weather data
- Implements rule-based crop recommendation (simulating ML model)
- Agricultural theme with green, brown, and blue colors
- Card-based dashboard layout
- All components created successfully
- City/village name feature added for better personalization
- Automatic location detection with reverse geocoding implemented
- Real-time location detection as users type coordinates
- GPS auto-detection now includes full location names
- Debounced API calls for optimal performance
